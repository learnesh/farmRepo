   * An animal moves to the farm. The new animal must have a barn to inhabitate and the barn must match the animal's

   * created it will be empty and have a capacity of 20 animals. No barn may house an amount of animals that exceed the
   * barn's capacity. Animals must be distributed between barns of the same color to allow for as much extra space
   * as possible with in each barn in order to optimize animal happiness. Keep in mind that when a new barn is added it
   * will require a redistribution of animals in other barns.

   * to maximize available space within the barn. When a second animal is added there is enough capacity to accomodate
   * the new animal so no new barns need to be created, but the animal must be added to the barn with fewer inhabitants
   * so the available space continues to be optimized across barns.
